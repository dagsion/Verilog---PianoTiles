This is the Piano Game designed using Hardware Description Language, Verilog. We incorporate a Finite State Machine to check for game logic. In addition, the PS/2 keyboard, VGA display, and Audio outputs are also incorporated into the design. The background music is played from memory. The VGA keyboard is rendered based on keyboard inputs despite FSM.
